*WIP*

Demonstrating probabilistic alternatives to group comparisons through the lens of microbiome research.


## Motivation

Frequentist methods are widespread and commonly used across fields when comparing groups.
Probabilistic and Bayesian methods have features that make them attractive alternatives. 
However, their widespread adoption is lacking. Bringing awareness to their strengths and 
interpretation lays the foundation for wider adoption within the field of microbiome research.
