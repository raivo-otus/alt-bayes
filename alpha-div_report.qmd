# 1. Introduction

In microbiome research it is common to compute alpha diversity metrics and compare them between two groups. Alpha diversity is a measure of the within sample diversity, and it is often computed as the number of observed species (richness), the Shannon index, or the Simpson index. Frequentist methods for comparing groups include the t-test and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. For comparision of more than two groups, Kruskal-Wallis test is commonly used, along with ANOVA and PERMANOVA. 

However, these methods have their shortcomings, and rely on assumptions that are often violated in practice when handling microbiome data (e.g. non-normality, heteroscedasticity, and sparsity). Probabilistic methods, provide a more flexible framework able to handle these issues in a robust way. Yet, they are not widely used in the field of microbiome research. Increasing awareness and showcasing the advantages of probabilistic methods as an alternative contributes to laying the foundation for wider adoption within the field. 

## 1.1. Alpha Diversity and the Shannon index

Higher alpha diversity, the diversity within a sample, is often associated in studies with a healthy state. A microbiome with high diversity is thought to be more resilient to perturbations, and more capable of performing a wide range of functions. The simplest measure of alpha diversity is just the number of observed species, richness, but this does not take into account relative abundances or other information about the community. The Shannon index is one such diversity measure that takes into account the distribution of taxa, or more precicsely how evenly they are distrubuted. Put simply, more species distributed evenly results in a higher Shannon index. Less species, with uneven distribution leads to a low index. Shannon index has the feature of being typically close to normally distributed in datasets.

## 1.2. Two sample t-test

The two sample t-test is a statistical test used to compare the means of two groups. It is based on the assumption that the data is normally distributed, and that the variances of the two groups are equal. The t-test returns a p-value, which indicates the probability of observing the data if the null hypothesis is true. The null hypothesis states that there is no difference between the two groups. If the p-value is below a certain threshold (e.g. 0.05), we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference between the two groups. The t-test assumes that both groups have the same variance, the welch t-test is a variation of the t-test that does not assume equal variances, and is more robust to violations of this assumption.

The t-test is only able to reject the null hypothesis, or fail to reject it. It does not provide any information about the size of the effect, or the probability of the effect size. This is a major limitation of the t-test, as it does not provide any information about the practical significance of the difference between the two groups.

## 1.3. A bayesian alternative

Bayesian or probabilistic alternatives to the t-test come with their own set of limitations. There is also no agreement on which is the best alternative, as there are a few approuches. Kruschke (2013) suggests a method termed BEST (bayesian estimation supersedes t test) that relies on the posterior distributions of the groups and their difference. It is able to provide more informative inference and is able to accept the null hypothesis. The decision is based on HDI and the concept of ROPE (region of practical equivalence). A high value for ROPE---a big proportion of the HDI is within the ROPE---indicates that there is no significant difference between the two groups. A low value conversly indicates that there is a significant difference. As these values are computed from the posterior distributions, they can provide a more nuanced view of the data. The BEST -method has its limitations as it is only really usable for two groups, and the model structure while flexible is complex and requires careful consideration of the priors. It can however be used for even small datasets, and is able to handle non-normality and heteroscedasticity (Kruschke, 2013).

Other alternatives have been proposed, which rely on the Bayes factor. They are in essance a model comparison, where the Bayes factor is used to compare the null model (no difference between the groups) to the alternative model (difference between the groups). The Bayes factor is a ratio of the posterior probabilities of the two models, and can be used to assess the strength of evidence for or against the null hypothesis (Kelter, 2021). 

# 2. Case-study

In this case-study we will analyze the alpha diversity differences across two geographical regions, Ahmednagar and Nashik. The data is included in the `mia` package and is a subset of the `peerj13075` dataset. This dataset contains skin microbial profiles, generated from 16S amplicon sequencing data.

## 2.1. Data preparation

```{r}
#| label: setup
#| echo: false
#| output: false 

# load libraries
library(mia)
library(scater)


# Load example dataset
data("peerj13075", package = "mia")
tse <- peerj13075
```

The `peerj13075` dataset contains skin microbial profiles from 58 volunteers. Data is from 16S amplicon sequencing and contains samples from across 3 regions. 

```{r}
#| label: data-wrangling

# Selecting only two regions
tse <- tse[, tse$Geographical_location %in% c("Ahmednagar", "Nashik")]
dim(tse)
```

Keeping the samples from the regions of Ahmednagar and Nashik we retain `r dim(tse)[2]` samples.

```{r}
#| label: addAlpha

# Adding Shannon index
tse <- addAlpha(
    tse,
    assay.type = "counts",
    index = "shannon",
    detection = 10
)

# Plotting 
plotColData(
    tse,
    "shannon",
    "Geographical_location") +
    labs(
        x = "Geographical location",
        y = "Shannon index"
    ) +
    theme_bw()
```

After computing the Shannon index the plotted data shows that between the two regions there doesn't appear to be large difference, although within the samples from Ahmednagar there is a wider range of Shanon index values.

## 2.2. The t-test

To confirm with statistical testing whether the regions differ in Shannon index we can use a t-test. One of the assumptions of the t-test is the normality of the data. The violin plot above suggests that the data is approximately normally distributed.
Which is good enough for now.

```{r}
#| label: t-test

# Performing t-test
tRes <- t.test(
    tse$shannon[tse$Geographical_location == "Ahmednagar"],
    tse$shannon[tse$Geographical_location == "Nashik"]
)

tRes
```

The t-test returns a p-value of `r format.pval(tRes$p.value, digits = 3)` with the confidence interval of `r paste0("(", round(tRes$conf.int[1], 2), ", ", round(tRes$conf.int[2], 2), ")")`. The t-test suggests that there is no significant difference in Shannon index between the two regions. 
We fail to reject the null hypothesis. 

## 2.3. A probabilistic alternative

As Kruschke (2013) points out in his paper, the probabilistic alternative to comparing two groups is able to provide more information, an intuitive interpretation, and a more robust framework. All without touching p-values, often misunderstood.

The approach Kruschke (2013) suggests---bayesian estimation supersedes t test (BEST)---is to compute the posterior distribution of the difference between the two groups. This is done by sampling from the posterior distribution of each group, and then computing the difference between them. The posterior distribution of the difference can then be used to compute credible intervals, and to assess whether the two groups differ.

The BEST model uses bayesian estimation to estimate 5 parameters in total. The mean and sd of each group, and a hyperparameter that controls the level of normality of the t-distribution. From the two distributions for the groups posterior draws can be made, and a posterior distribution for the difference computed. From this distribution the decision and inference can be made, based on HDI (highest density interval, e.g. 89%) and the area inside the ROPE (region of practical equivalence.)

Based on the BEST -method we find that the difference in Shannon index between the two regions is inconclusive. We neither reject or accept the null hypothesis, based on Kruschke's (2013) decision boundries using HDI and ROPE. Additionally, the posterior distribution of effect size suggests a small effect size. Together, these results suggest that while there is a difference in mean Shannon index between the two regions, we do not have enough evidence to conclude that the difference is practically significant. At best we can say that there is a small difference, but it is not large enough to reject the possibility of practical equivalence. 

# 3. Conclusion

In this case-study we have demonstrated how to use a probabilistic alternative to the two sample t-test, the BEST -method, to compare alpha diversity between two groups. The BEST -method is able to provide more information than the t-test, and is able to handle non-normality and heteroscedasticity. It is also able to accept the null hypothesis, and provide a more nuanced view of the data. However as Kelter (2021) points out both approuches to testing have their limitations and nuances. Bayesian or probabilistic methods have stronger control for type I error, and provide flexible modeling options with richer inference, at the cost of complexity and higher type II error. In contrast frequentist methods remain straightforward, entrenched in tradition, and control better for type II error (Kelter, 2021).
